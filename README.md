## Abstract

FedSecurePdM is a modular three-tier federated learning architecture designed for industrial predictive maintenance (PdM). The framework combines edge-level anomaly screening, a dynamic reputation engine, and secure aggregation mechanisms to improve robustness against Byzantine clients while preserving data privacy.

By integrating lightweight PCA-based detection, game-theoretic reputation weighting, and secure prognostic modeling, the framework enables reliable Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation under adversarial and non-IID industrial environments.

## Research Motivation

Traditional predictive maintenance solutions often rely on centralized data collection, introducing privacy risks, communication overhead, and vulnerability to malicious participants.

SecurePdM-FL addresses these challenges by combining Federated Learning with Byzantine fault-tolerant mechanisms, enabling secure and scalable predictive maintenance across distributed industrial infrastructures.

## ✨ Key Contributions
- Three-tier federated architecture for predictive maintenance
- Edge-based PCA anomaly screening
- Dynamic game-theoretic reputation mechanism
- Byzantine fault-tolerant model aggregation
- Privacy-preserving secure aggregation
- Robust operation under non-IID industrial environments
